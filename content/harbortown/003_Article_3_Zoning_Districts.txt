Article 3. Zoning Districts

3.1 I-H, Heavy Industrial District
A.	Purpose and Intent
This district accommodates uses that are highly hazardous, environmentally intense, or generate 
substantial volumes of truck traffic. It is intended to provide sites for intensive manufacturing, 
processing, distribution, and major transportation terminal activities that have greater impacts than 
those permitted in the “I-1” districts. Heavy industrial districts are typically located along major 
freight corridors, arterial thoroughfares, and railway lines to ensure convenient access for existing 
and future industrial operations.
