3.1 R-1, Low Density Residential 
A. Purpose and Intent
The R-1 Low Density Residential District is intended to maintain low-density, primarily 
single-family neighborhoods with stable housing, limited traffic, and predictable 
development patterns. This district preserves traditional detached homes on larger lots and 
restricts higher-density housing types commonly found in older city center neighborhoods.
