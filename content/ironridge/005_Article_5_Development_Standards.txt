Article 5. Development Standards
5.1 Building Setbacks
a.	Front setback: Minimum 20–25 feet to maintain uniform lawns and discourage 
rowhouse-style, sidewalk-fronted housing typical of older neighborhoods.
b.	 Rear setback: Minimum 25 feet to preserve private yard space and limit lot 
coverage.
c.	Side setbacks:
•	Minimum 5 feet between homes
•	Minimum 10 feet when next to multifamily or commercial 
These limits reduce the ability to build attached housing or add additional 
units.
d.	Homes are generally centered on the lot and may not be placed directly at the front 
property line.
5.2	 Parking and Sidewalk 
a.	Two (2) off-street parking spaces required per dwelling unit.
b.	Driveways must remain on-site and cannot replace required green space.
c.	A 5-foot-wide sidewalk is required along all public streets.
5.3	 Lot Coverage
a.	Maximum of 35–40% of the lot may be covered by structures. 
This restricts expansion or multi-unit conversions.
b.	Yard and green areas must remain open, with limited exceptions for garages.

5.4	 Buffers
a.	When R-1 abuts commercial or multifamily zones, a 10-foot landscape buffer is 
required to reduce perceived impacts.
b.	Buffers may include trees, shrubs, or a 6-foot fence to maintain “neighborhood 
character.”
